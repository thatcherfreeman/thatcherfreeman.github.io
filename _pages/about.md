## Thatcher Freeman

Thatcher is the lead color scientist and developer behind Thatcher Imaging. Thatcher grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley, California, where he developed an interest in photography at a young age. This evolved into a passion for cinematography, filmmaking and storytelling. He has a Master's of Science from Stanford University, where he studied machine learning.

Thatcher's introduction to color science began when he acquired a Z-Cam E2, whose color space specifications were not disclosed by the manufacturer. In 2022, he started development on a regression tool to build a superior, symbolic transform to integrate the camera into standard workflows, such as ACES, and to allow for compositing of rendered elements into the original camera files. Ever since, he has been applying his software engineering and data science background towards the use-cases of cinema image pipelines, building tools and benchmarks for colorists around the world.

## Misha Beare

Misha is the on-call colorist for Thatcher Imaging. Located in Cape Town, South Africa, Misha works on some of the highest profile shows in his country. He collaborates with Thatcher Imaging by stress testing our tools and finding novel use-cases and functionality for the team to develop. He has a sharp eye for image artifacts that go unnoticed by other colorists and a strong focus on robust workflows, making him invaluable to the team.
